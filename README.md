# Musikill!

An endless runner retro-style arcade video game made using Pygame library for Python


## Appendix

Musikill is a simple arcade game inspired by the retro era of video games. The artwork and game design is an attempt to pay homage to the 16-bit video games era we all grew up with and loved.

#### It follows our protagonist, a 70s inspired Rockstar on his musical journey (literally) which features familiar foes like- Mr. Grand Piano and Mr. Trumpet that he must defeat using his beloved weapon, his overdriven guitar and pitch-perfect jumping skills! 

- It currently has an endless runner mechanic similar to the Chrome Dino runner.
- High Score for each play is measured in seconds.
- Goal is to dodge the enemies for as long as you can.
 A proper firing mechanism would be added to the game in its upcoming versions.

Controls:

Space: Jump (lol)
